# Welcome to Mi'raj Aeronautics and Space Exploration Laboratories (MiASEL)

Welcome to our cosmic journey at MiASEL! Though we're taking our first baby steps into a vast, unexplored universe, our dreams are gigantic. Based in Pakistan, we're a passionate team inspired by cosmic ascensions of ancient tales to venture boldly into the space-age revolution.

## Our Inspiration & Dream

> "O assembly of jinn and men! If you have the power to pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, then pass beyond [them]. But you shall never be able to pass them, except with extraordinary power." (Al-Rehman: 33) 

Our quest is stirred by the timeless words from Surah Rehman, a beautiful reminder of the majestic vastness of space and our place within it. Our dream is audacious - to dare march into the limitless cosmos and to leave an undeniable footprint of humanity there.

## Our Journey

We may be novices in this domain, but it's our unquenchable thirst for knowledge and discovery that fuels us. We cherish the learning process - every bit of knowledge about spacecraft, every understanding of our universeâ€™s rules.
